# What is this project about?
This project is intended as a proof of concept for providing a service for printing pager messages decoded (PDW/Pagermon), and stored as readable text in a database.

Once the database receives a new message, this app will ingest it and provide it on a printable/printed PDF with the pager message and other reporting details (Vehicle Details, Crew, Weather, etc.)




# Important Notes
- There is no promise this project will become production-ready. It is a learning experience and may experience significat tech debt
- There will be more, give it time
